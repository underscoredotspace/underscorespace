## A Blog?

Well, it's about time I started sharing the things I learn at work and in my personal projects. I've been here many times "writing a blog", but in reality I've always been more focused on creating a blogging **platform** than actually creating useful content.

I've chosen to make this blog as static as possible. Yes, I'm using Next.js to render everything, but there's no CMS, no database. In-fact, I'm determined to make the whole thing able to run without JavaScript and be usable without CSS.

### The Technolgy holding this nonsense together

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
-   As much idiomatic [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) as possible (yay baked-in accessibility!)

That's pretty much it for now. I think that one day there will be a CMS behind this, but only because I intend to create a fairly generic CMS for another website I'm working on.
