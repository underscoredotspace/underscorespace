## The Author

I'm [Colin Tindle](https://linkedin.com/in/underscoredotspace), a front-end web developer based in Glasgow, UK. I work for FanDuel, on a hybrid React Native/React Web application.

As much as I love working with React and React Native, my first love is the web. HTML, CSS and "vanilla" JavaScript have been at the core of my personal projects for a very long time.

I have a [portfolio](https://messy.cloud) (yes, vanilla) showing a bunch of these off. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/_dotSpace) also host much of my webby shenanigans. Oh, and of course [GitHub](https://github.com/underscoredotspace).

Currently, I'm learning Next.js which is a really exciting way to develop for me. Being able to write React component based apps, which can be run without JavaScript enabled, is great for most websites I find myself making outside of work - **this one** included.

Of course I'm out there on social media, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_dotSpace), [Instagram](https://instagr.am/colinfoldsfive) but I don't post that much just now.
