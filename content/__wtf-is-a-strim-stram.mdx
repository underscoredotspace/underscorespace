## Using "useless" projects to learn a new thing

Sometimes it's fun just to make a website for the sake of trying out a new thing. Occasionally I get the idea, and motivation to create something.

As a Christmas gift to my favourite streaming community, I created what some people might call a "face filter".

<img
    src="/strim.png"
    alt="screenshot of strim app"
    className="mx-auto max-h-72 object-cover"
/>

The idea came from the start of most Twitch streams, where the streamer is generally chatting with their camera displaying them in full screen.

Depending on what software the streamer uses, emotes posted in the chat show over their image and bounce around the screen for a while.

Unless you watch streams, this all sounds very boring but there's a lot of hype involved, normally when someone subscribes or a party from another stream "raids".

### What my app does

There's two parts:

#### Webcam

-   captures your webcam image and displays it on screen
-   applies a blue filter
-   uses face detection to position headphones and cap

#### Bouncing emotes

-   buttons let you add emotes
-   emotes bounce of edges of screen

### Emotes

I'll describe how the emotes work since it's a great deal less complex.
